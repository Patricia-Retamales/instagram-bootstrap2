# The Instagram Photo Feed (with Bootstrap)

As a developer, you are given the task to replicate a picture as a website.

## ðŸŒ±  How to start this project

Do not clone this repository. The first step to start coding is cloning the [html boilerplate](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-hello) on your local computer or opening it using gitpod.

a) If using Gitpod (recommended) you can clone the boilerplate by [clicking here](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-hello).

b) If working locally type the following command from your command line: 

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-hello

````
ðŸ’¡ Important: Remember to create a new repository, update the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and upload the code to your new repository using `add`, `commit` and `push`.

## Instructions

1. Create a website that looks exactly like [this one](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-instagram-feed-bootstrap/blob/master/preview.gif):

![Instagram Preview](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-instagram-feed-bootstrap/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true)

2. Before starting to code make a drawing of the website with all the bootstrap components you will be using. Use as many components as you can, you will probably reuse them for the rest of your life!

3. Once the components are identified start with the navbar (from top to bottom) and try adapting the examples you find on the internet to what you are asked on the picture. Don't just copy and paste, understand and tweak, if you don't understand the names of the classes used in the component you will end up hitting a wall and being frustrated.

4. Use all the possible [bootstrap utilities (helpers)](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities), take your time to read them all because it will make your life 99% easier.

5. The projects have to be 100% responsive using the bootstrap grid system.


### Resources

You have the online lesson about bootstrap and the cheat sheet about bootstrap in the assets section. We also recommend [Net Ninja's video tutorials on bootstrap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAgrHLtG1Yk).

### What to do if you are stuck?

- Clean the cache (always refresh with command+shift+R), using the incognito mode on Google Chrome. 
- Look in google for solutions. 
- Talk to the other students. 
- Talk to senior developers you know. 
- Talk to the mentors over slack.

### What **NOT** to do if you are stuck??

- Don't get frustrated and think you are not good at this: All the developers get stuck all the time, ask around! How do you know if you are good at something that you don't know? Coding is a science, facts matter and you have no facts. 

- Don't keep wandering around for hours without seeking help: Google is only as useful as you are good at googling, please speak to other students or your instructors. 

- Change strategy: Einstein once said, if you do the same stuff you will get the same results.
